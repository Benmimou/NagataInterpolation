# NagataInterpolation

Quadratic interpolation of curves in 2D and 3D based on two points and their corresponding normal vectors. Also, quadratic interpolation of triangular patches based on three points and their corresponding normal vectors. This is a Matlab implementation of interpolation methods in Nagata, T. (2005). Simple local interpolation of surfaces using normal vectors. Computer Aided Geometric Design, 22(4), 327-347.

Start by running tests in Examples directory.

-Input for curves in 2D: 2 points and 2 corresponding normals.
-Input for curves in 3D: 2 points and 2 corresonding normals.
-Input for patches in 3D: 3 points, their connectivity (triangle), 3 corresponding normals.
